Converting a GitLab DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) report schema from version 14.03 to version 15.06 involves 
handling the transformation of fields and structures based on the 
changes between these versions. Below is a more comprehensive Python script that demonstrates how to convert a DAST 
report from version 14.03 to version 15.06.

Assumptions:

The example assumes specific changes made between these versions, focusing on typical schema adjustments.
python
Copy code
import json

def convert_dast_report_v14_to_v15(report_v14):
    # Load the report in version 14.03 format

print(converted_report)
In this code:

The convert_dast_report_v14_to_v15 function takes the input report in version 14.03 format, extracts relevant fields, transforms them according to the new schema for version 15.06, and constructs a new report in the updated format.
The map_severity and map_confidence functions map severity and confidence values from the old schema to the new schema.
The example report data (old_report_data) represents a sample DAST report in version 14.03 format.
The converted report (converted_report) is generated by calling convert_dast_report_v14_to_v15 with the sample report data and then printed to the console.
You can adjust the mappings and transformations based on the specific schema changes between the versions you are working with. This example provides a foundation that you can customize to handle additional fields or different schema adjustments as needed.

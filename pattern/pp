# Convert this Django project code to use the Flask framework.
# Replace Django-specific imports, views, models, routing, and settings with Flask equivalents.
# Key conversion points:
# - Replace 'django.urls' and 'urlpatterns' with Flask route decorators.
# - Replace Django views (class-based or function-based) with Flask route functions.
# - Replace Django ORM models with SQLAlchemy models if needed.
# - Replace Django templates (render with context) with Flask's `render_template`.
# - Replace settings.py and wsgi.py with appropriate Flask app initialization.
# - Remove middleware and Django-specific decorators or replace with Flask-compatible ones.

# Use Flask best practices for folder structure and configuration.
# Ensure the converted code runs independently without Django dependencies.

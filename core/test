📊 [TITLE SLIDE]

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment
Vulnerability Assessment Strategy
Presented by: [Your Name]
Role: Senior Cybersecurity Architect
Date: [Insert Date]


---

🔍 1. Objective

Ensure the UAT environment is secure, compliant, and free from exploitable vulnerabilities before go-live.

Identify, assess, and remediate any security weaknesses in systems, applications, and third-party integrations tested in UAT.

Align UAT security posture with production-like security controls.



---

🧭 2. Scope of Assessment

Component	In-Scope

Application Servers	Web apps, APIs, mobile interfaces
Backend Systems	Databases, Message Queues
Infrastructure	OS, Network Devices, Firewalls
CI/CD Pipelines	Build & Deployment Tools
Third-Party Integrations	APIs, Auth providers, external links
IAM and Access Controls	Role-based access in UAT
Test Data	Pseudonymized or masked production



---

🔐 3. Security Requirements for UAT

No hardcoded credentials or secrets in code

Data must be masked or tokenized

Test accounts must have limited privileges

Logging must be enabled and monitored

External exposure must be restricted by IP allowlist

Align with OWASP, CIS Benchmarks, and NIST 800-53



---

⚙️ 4. Assessment Methodology

1. Discovery

Identify assets and environment boundary

Inventory of exposed services and endpoints


2. Vulnerability Scanning

Use tools like Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, or Burp Suite


3. Manual Verification

Validate critical vulnerabilities

Perform logic-based security test cases


4. Threat Modeling

Identify attack surfaces and misconfigurations


5. Reporting & Risk Rating

CVSS scoring

Business impact analysis



---

🛠️ 5. Tools & Techniques

Category	Tools Used

Network Scanning	Nmap, Qualys, Tenable
Web App Scanning	Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP
SAST (optional in UAT)	SonarQube, Checkmarx
DAST	OWASP ZAP, Netsparker
Infrastructure Scanning	Tenable, ScoutSuite, Prowler (AWS)
Secrets Detection	GitLeaks, TruffleHog



---

🚦 6. Vulnerability Prioritization Matrix

CVSS Score	Risk Level	Remediation Timeline

9.0 - 10.0	Critical	Immediate (within 24 hrs)
7.0 - 8.9	High	Within 2 business days
4.0 - 6.9	Medium	Within UAT cycle
0.1 - 3.9	Low	Documented & deferred



---

🔁 7. Remediation Workflow

1. Vulnerability Identified


2. Assigned to Development/DevSecOps


3. Fix implemented and verified in UAT


4. Retest and closure


5. Root cause analysis (optional)




---

📊 8. Reporting & KPIs

Total vulnerabilities by severity

Mean time to remediate (MTTR)

Vulnerability recurrence rate

% of critical/high risks remediated before go-live



---

🧩 9. UAT Security Gate Criteria

✅ All Critical & High vulnerabilities remediated
✅ Security acceptance testing passed
✅ No production data leakage
✅ Approval from Cybersecurity & QA leads


---

📅 10. Timeline

Phase	Duration

Environment Readiness	2 days
Scanning & Testing	3-5 days
Remediation Cycle	2-3 days
Retesting & Closure	1-2 days



---

✅ 11. Final Recommendations

Ensure UAT is treated as a pre-production security mirror

Embed DevSecOps into UAT pipelines

Enable real-time dashboards for risk monitoring

Make this assessment mandatory before release sign-off



---

🙏 12. Questions & Next Steps

Open discussion for feedback

Confirm go-ahead from QA/Dev/Release teams
